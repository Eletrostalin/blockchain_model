# Blockchain Model on FastAPI â€“ One of the First Projects

This is an early project demonstrating a blockchain model built with FastAPI. A database is not used to allow for a clear demonstration of data changes directly within a block stored in a text file.

## About the Project

This is one of my first projects in Python â€“ a simple blockchain model. I deliberately avoided using any databases, storing blocks directly in the root directory for clarity. Users can edit the blocks, but in that case, integrity checks will fail. 

It's a fun project that can even be shown to parents to help them understand the concept of blockchain! ðŸ˜Š
